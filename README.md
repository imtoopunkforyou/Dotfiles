# 🐧 dotfiles
My configuration of some environments.

## ⚠️ Warning
These configurations are tailored exclusively to my personal needs and workflow.  
Before using them:

- Don’t blindly copy! Many settings are optimized for my hardware, software versions, and subjective preferences.

- Review every change — some configurations may conflict with your existing setup.

- Backup your files before overwriting anything.

- Adapt them to your environment — I recommend studying the changes and borrowing only what you fully understand.

- Incompatibilities are likely.
